# 🎮 Simon Says Game

**Simon Says** is a classic memory-based browser game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The player must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colored buttons shown on the screen. With every successful round, the sequence gets longer — testing your memory and focus.

This project was developed as part of my journey in frontend development, to improve my skills in **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and responsive UI design using vanilla JavaScript.
